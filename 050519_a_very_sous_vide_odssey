# A Very Sous Vide Odyssey

by namt, May 4th, 2019

## Past Version
Back in late 2017 I got a chance to make a sous vide machine out of an old, cheap rice cooker. I tooked out most of the internals, including the thermistor, then hooked up the heating element to an ESP8266 with an OLED, DS18B20 Temperature sensor, and an SSR Relay.

I programmed the board in Arduino, and it worked. Somewhat. It was a hack job and it wasn't even possible to change the target temperature on the fly as it was hard coded. But it worked well enough to make me some delicious lamb chops to impress my girlfriend's parents.

Shortly after, I had to move and with heavy stomach, I took apart the contraption. I am determined to pick it up again some other time.

## Mark II
After moving back to Vietnam, I came across this old Sharp rice cooker at a flea market. It's fully functional, and for the low low price of 200,000 VND ($8.65, what a steal!) 

New models go for [1.490.000 VND](https://mediamart.vn/noi-com-dien/sharp/noi-com-dien-18l-ks-zt18.htm) ($64!!!)
